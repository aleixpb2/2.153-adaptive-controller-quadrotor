# 2.153 Class Project: Adaptive Control of a Quadrotor UAV

Class project for MIT's *Adaptive Control and Connections to Machine Learning* (subject number 2.153).
The project consists in an adaptive controller for a quadrotor which is robust to parametric uncertainties such as a rotor failure.
The paper can be found [here](Aleix_Paris_Report.pdf) and the video [here](video/adaptive_controller_v1.mp4) (click on "Download" to visualize).
